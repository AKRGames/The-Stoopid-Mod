**MODS FOLDER GUIDE**

In order to load in mods, it HAS to be in the mainMods/_append folder. 
Why? This is to have backup support for when week 7 polymod actually releases.
So if you wanna put in a mod for the shared/ folder then you put it in:

```mods/mainMods/_append/shared```

A reminder that this doesnt just work like a charm just yet!!!! This is experimental and can lead to some issues.
